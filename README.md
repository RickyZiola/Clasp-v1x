# Clasp
* Clasp is a high-level, statically typed programming language designed to run on any device. It uses [Christian_5](https://github.com/cristian-5)'s [VirtualICE](https://github.com/cristian-5/virtualice) VM as a bytecode language, but through the [WIP] build targeting system, that can be transpiled to any assembly or bytecode language.
